# Cybersecurity Repository

Welcome to the **Cybersecurity** repository! This project is a collection of **resources, labs, and documentation** aimed at improving your knowledge and practical skills in cybersecurity. The content is organized around the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** and other important concepts, helping both beginners and professionals understand and apply critical security practices.

## Table of Contents

1. [NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)](NIST/README.md)
   - This folder contains comprehensive documentation on the **five core functions** of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.
   - Each function explains **key practices**, provides **example controls**, and highlights **why each practice matters** in real-world cybersecurity.

2. [Labs](Labs/)  
   - The **Labs** folder contains hands-on exercises and projects that will help you apply the knowledge from the NIST framework and other cybersecurity topics.
   - **Get started** with practical exercises that cover everything from network security to incident response.

3. [Notes](Notes/)  
   - The **Notes** folder includes additional resources such as **research papers**, **tutorials**, and **reference material** to further support your learning journey.
   - Use these resources for deeper dives into specific areas like encryption, threat modeling, and vulnerability assessment.

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

The NIST CSF provides a **structured approach** for managing cybersecurity risks. It consists of five core functions: **Identify**, **Protect**, **Detect**, **Respond**, and **Recover**. Each function has been broken down into detailed documentation, available in the [NIST folder](NIST/).

## Labs

The **Labs** folder provides hands-on exercises for building practical cybersecurity skills. These labs will give you the opportunity to:
- Work with **network security tools** like firewalls, IDS/IPS systems, and VPNs
- Simulate **cybersecurity incidents** and respond according to best practices
- Set up **secure environments** for web applications, databases, and servers

Feel free to explore and contribute new labs or modify existing ones as part of your learning!

## Notes

In the **Notes** folder, you’ll find supplementary materials and **study notes** on:
- **Cybersecurity concepts**: Encryption, authentication, firewalls, etc.
- **Tools and techniques**: Penetration testing, malware analysis, etc.
- **Research papers**: Stay up-to-date with the latest trends and findings in cybersecurity.
