# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

This folder contains documentation for the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**, which is a widely used guide for managing and reducing cybersecurity risks. The framework is organized into five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

Each section explains **key practices, example controls, and why it matters** in real-world cybersecurity.

## Sections

1. [Identify (ID)](Identify.md)  
   Understand your assets, data, and risks to focus your security efforts effectively.

2. [Protect (PR)](Protect.md)  
   Implement safeguards to prevent or limit cybersecurity incidents.

3. [Detect (DE)](Detect.md)  
   Identify cybersecurity events quickly to respond before damage escalates.

4. [Respond (RS)](Respond.md)  
   Take action on detected incidents to contain and mitigate the impact.

5. [Recover (RC)](Recover.md)  
   Restore systems and improve resilience after a cybersecurity incident.
