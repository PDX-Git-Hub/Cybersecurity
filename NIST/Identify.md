# Identify (ID)

**Purpose:**  
Understand what assets, data, and risks exist so security efforts are focused and effective.

## Key Practices

- Identify sensitive data (PII, credentials, financial data)
- Define roles and responsibilities
- Identify threats and vulnerabilities
- Conduct basic risk assessments

## Example Controls
- Asset inventory spreadsheets

## Why It Matters
If an organization does not know what it owns or what data is critical, it cannot properly protect it.
