# Protect (PR)

**Purpose:**  
Implement safeguards to limit or contain the impact of cybersecurity incidents.

## Key Practices
- Enforce strong passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Apply least privilege access controls
- Provide security awareness training for all users
- Keep systems and software up to date with patches
- Use antivirus and endpoint protection
- Configure firewalls and network segmentation

## Example Controls
- MFA enabled on all accounts
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Endpoint protection and antivirus software
- Patch management schedule

## Why It Matters
Protection reduces the likelihood that an attacker can successfully compromise systems and ensures critical assets remain safe.
